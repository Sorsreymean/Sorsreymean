                  No, You need to integrate with QuickBooks for the most part.
                  Although there are FaceAzure modules like Payroll that can
                  function independently of QuickBooks, your main lists and
                  journals have to be retrieved from QuickBooks to give you a
                  complete ecosystem experience. Therefore we advise you to get
                  QuickBooks first. Opportunely, we at CAS-BIZ Technology are
                  authorized to implement and support QuickBooks so you do not
